Chapter 1 is not a comprehensive manual of Python. Rather, it aims to bring you up to speed with sufficent information about python so that you can pick up the rest as you go. Presumably, you know something about another computer language.

Python is an object-oriented language (Fun fact: its name is derived from the British television show Monty Python's Flying Circus). Python is an excellent scripting language for enigeering applications. Very elegant and considerably more widespread than Fortran.

Python programs are not compiled into machine code, but are run by an interpreter (the python interpreter also compiles byte code, which helps to speed up execution somewhat.). Therefore, Python, as one of interpreted language, can be tested and debugged quickly, allowing users to concentrate more on the principles behind the program. 

Python programs can be developed in a much shorter time than equivalent Fortran or C programs. However, python applications cannot stand alone. That is, a Python program cannot be run without the help of Python interpreter.

Advantages of Python:
1. Open-source software, 'free', included in most Linux distributions;
2. Avaiable for Linux,Unix,Windows, MacOS etc. Interchangable within two different systems;
3. Easy to learn and more readable than other languages;
4. Its extensions and itself are easy to install.

Java and C++ have a great impact on the development of python, Python is also similar to MATLAB. Python implements the usual concepts of object-oriented languages such as classes, methods, inheritance etc.
