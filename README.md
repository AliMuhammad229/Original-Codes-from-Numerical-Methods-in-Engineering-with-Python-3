Book : Numerical Methods in Engineering with Python 2.X

Preface:

1. The book is for engineers and engineering students (sophomores, seniors and graduate students) who are supposed to be familiar with computer language and have basic knowledge of engineering.

2. This book focuses on numerical methods, rather than programming. Engineers are expected to learn how to utilized functions and subroutines which have already existed and assemble them into a coherent package that can probably solve the problems at hand. 

3. As said, you need to pay attention to the rationale behind these numerical methods not the algorithm itself. 

4. More specifically, the rationale refers to the inner workings of the method and its shortcomings. 

5. The topics covered in this book include: solution of equations, interpolation and data fitting, numerical differentiation and integration, solution of Ordinary Differential Equations and eigenvalue problems. More specifically, each topic is tilted toward relevance to engineering problems. 

6. One criterion for selection of methods is clarity. This is an attempt to conform the views outlined above. That is, try to avoid overemphasizing on programming. 

7. Another criterion is to keep this book up to date. Examples: 1. Roots of equations: Brent's method more favorable than the secant method; 2. Runge-Kutta and Bulirsch-Stoer methods more favorable than Milne and Adams methods, thus being chosen.

8. The chapter on partial differential equations (PDEs) is left out in this book because the commonly-used finite difference model is impractical in tackling multidimensional boundary value problems (it can be well treated by finite element or boundary element methods.

9. The programs can be run with Python 2.2.2 and 2.3.4 under XP and RHL.
